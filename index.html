        <p>    CrySP is an area of computer science focusing on keeping you and everyone else safe in the internet. CrySP stands for Cryptography, Security, and Priviacy. CrySP is important to everyone who uses the internet for anything from looking at videos to their online banking, but how does it work? </p>
        
        <p> To understand how CrySP works and how it keeps you safe on the internet we first need to discuss the ancienct art of Cryptography for a little bit. </p>
        
        <h2> Cryptography</h2>
            <ul> 
                <li>Cryptography is the science of writing and deciphering secret messages using a special key, (hopefully) known only to the intended target and the sender of the message. On the internet we use a similar principle to keep our data safe. We apply the idea of cryptography to our data transmissions with the concept of encryption. To put it simply there are two types of encryption commonly used. Symmetric key encryption and Asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses a single encryption key to encrypt and decrypt the data. To you this might just be a jumble of words that have no meaning, so lets clear things up and discuss what an encryption key actually is and then come back to types of encryption.

        <h3> Encryption Keys </h3>
        <p class="para2">Although they sound complicated encryption keys are actually really simple once you boil them down to a basic state.<br> Chances are you've used a basic form of encryption and encryption key in your childhood. Writing and speaking in Pig Latin is a really basic form of using an encryption key. In this case the key you are using to encrypt your message is to take the first letter of the word and move it to the end, then add "-ay" to the end. When the person on the recieving end of the message wants to decode it they undo the encryption key and turn the message back to normal. There you go, a very basic example of what an encryption key is. Keep in mind that this isn't exactly what an encryption key is but for our sake it is a good way to rationalise this complex idea. <br> Up until this point I've done my best to refrain from using difficult language but now I'm going to introduce two new words to make life just a little bit eaysier.</p> 
        <ol class="list1">
            <li>Plaintext: any sort of normal text or information, like what your reading right now. </li>
            <li>Cyphertext: text or information that has been encrypted.</li>
            <li> Small change </li>
