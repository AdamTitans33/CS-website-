        <h1>   What is CrySP and What does it Mean? </h1>

        <p>CrySP is an area of computer science focusing on keeping you and everyone else safe in the internet. CrySP stands for Cryptography, Security, and Priviacy. CrySP is important to everyone who uses the internet for anything from looking at videos to their online banking, but how does it work? </p>
        
        <p> To understand how CrySP works and how it keeps you safe on the internet we first need to discuss the ancienct art of Cryptography for a little bit. </p>
        
        <h2> Cryptography</h2>
            <ul> 
                <li>Cryptography is the science of writing and deciphering secret messages using a special key, (hopefully) known only to the intended target and the sender of the message. On the internet we use a similar principle to keep our data safe. We apply the idea of cryptography to our data transmissions with the concept of encryption. To put it simply there are two types of encryption commonly used. Symmetric key encryption and Asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses a single encryption key to encrypt and decrypt the data. To you this might just be a jumble of words that have no meaning, so lets clear things up and discuss what an encryption key actually is and then come back to types of encryption.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3> Encryption Keys </h3>
        <p class="para2">Although they sound complicated encryption keys are actually really simple once you boil them down to a basic state.<br> Chances are you've used a basic form of encryption and encryption key in your childhood. Writing and speaking in Pig Latin is a really basic form of using an encryption key. In this case the key you are using to encrypt your message is to take the first letter of the word and move it to the end, then add "-ay" to the end. When the person on the recieving end of the message wants to decode it they undo the encryption key and turn the message back to normal. There you go, a very basic example of what an encryption key is. Keep in mind that this isn't exactly what an encryption key is but for our sake it is a good way to rationalise this complex idea. <br> Up until this point I've done my best to refrain from using difficult language but now I'm going to introduce two new words to make life just a little bit eaysier.</p> 
        <ol class="list1">
            <li>Plaintext: any sort of normal text or information, like what your reading right now. </li>
            <li>Cyphertext: text or information that has been encrypted.</li>
            </ol>
       <h2> What Does Cryptography Do for Me?</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li> A simple way to answer this is with another question... What DOESN'T cryptography do for you? Any thing you have ever do on the internet is protected by some form of Cryptography. Any storing of data on a database or transmission of data uses cryptography to keep the data secret during its' transmission or storage. The Picture should give you a basic visual of how data transmission is effected and protected by cryptography  </li>
        </ul>
        <img class = "img2"  src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Symmetric_key_encryption.svg" alt = "Data transmission protected by an encryption key" />
             
        <ul>
            <li>
                <br>This image shows that Bob is sending some data, in the form of a message to Alice. Bob types his message as plaintext, during the process of sending the message is encrypted using an encryption key and converted to cyphertext. The message is sent to Alice and she recieves it as cyphertext. Once she recieves it the same encryption key is applied in order to decrypt the message and turn it into readable plaintext. <br>This is an example if symmetric key encryption, notice that there is only one key for encryption and decryption which is the same... hence the 'symmetric' classification. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If you haven't noticed this style of encryption is inherintly falwed becasue if you find the key you an access the information at any time. This is especially an issue for sending infromation over the intertnet. To combat this issue we have developed a second type of encryption which is more secure and more complicated to explain. 
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h2> Asymmetric Key Encription</h2>
            <p class = 'para2'> Asymmetric key encription is a more complicated and safer method of ecnrypting data, used primarly in tranferring data(remember that for our purposes data can be a message or a picture in an email). Asymmetric  key encryption involves two unqie keys one used to turn the plaintext into cyphertext and one used to undo this process on the recieving end.</p>
        <p class = 'para2'> To explain this a bit better we'll bring back Bob and Alice but this time their data is protected in a more sophisticated way.</p>
        <img class = 'img2' src= 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Public_key_encryption.svg/250px-Public_key_encryption.svg.png' alt = 'Data transmission protected by assymentric key encryption'/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                So what makes assymetric key encryption so much better for data on the move compaired to symmetric key encryption?
            </li>
            <li>
                Well to start off we can see that there are two different keys, one to encrypt and one to decrypt. This is useful because only one key - the "public" key- needs to move around on the internet and this is the key which wouldn't help hackers. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In the example above Alice is able to keep her secret key locally and not have it moving around on the internet which means it is safer than the public key and harder to acess by anyone other than Alice. Compare this to symmetric key encryption where there is only one key and it is being sent to the recipient along with the document, making it eaysier to access and eaysier to decode someone elses messages. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>When Do We Use Each?</h2>
        <p class = 'para2'> It is more common to use symmetric key encryption when data is being stored on a data base and only being accessed by people in that organization. This is because the data is not being moved around so one key will encrypt everything fine and make it eaysier to view as plaintext.</p>
        
        <p class = 'para2'> When data is being transferred between two points it is more common to use asymmetric key encryption because only one key is being moved around cyberspace  </p>
